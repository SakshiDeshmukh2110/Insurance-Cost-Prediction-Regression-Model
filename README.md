# Insurance-Cost-Prediction-Regression-Model
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built regression models to predict medical insurance charges based on factors like age, BMI, gender, region, and smoking habits. The project focuses on understanding variable impact, feature correlation, and model accuracy for cost prediction.

Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance charges using regression techniques.
The goal was to analyze how demographic and lifestyle factors (age, BMI, smoking status, etc.) influence insurance costs and to build an accurate predictive model.

🧹 Data Exploration & Cleaning

Handled missing and inconsistent values.

Analyzed distributions and outliers using boxplots and histograms.

Converted categorical variables into numerical form.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized relationships between features like age, BMI, children, and smoking.

Observed that smokers and higher BMI individuals had significantly higher charges.

Checked correlations to understand feature importance.

🤖 Model Building

Implemented Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression to predict charges.

Compared model performance using metrics like R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Tuned parameters to improve model accuracy.

🏁 Results

Identified key predictors of insurance cost.

Linear Regression performed well for continuous data prediction.

Learned the importance of feature scaling and outlier handling.
